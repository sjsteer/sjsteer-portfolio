Hi! My name is Shayne Steer and I'm a second year student at Monash University! I made this platform as a coding exercise and an opportunity to share my experiences and thoughts about various technologies. 
I am currently undertaking Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Computer Science, with majors in Data Science and Pharmacology.

During my time at Monash, I have come to appreciate the fine interplay between health sciences and machine learning, and would love to focus on the usage of machine learning to optimize clinical trials.
