# Shayne Steer's Project Portfolio
Hello! :wave:

This project is a placeholder for my Jekyll blog hosted [here](https://shaynesteer.me/), which houses all of my personal projects.

Upon pushing to the master branch, I use a [Github Action](https://github.com/sjsteer/sjsteer-portfolio/blob/master/.github/workflows/github-pages.yml) to spin up an Ubuntu machine, install dependancies, build static pages and checkout the gh-pages branch. 

This was the best setup for me as it allows me to publish my work instantly (within 40 seconds) to the web, whilst also being allowed to use all the cool features in Jekyll 4.0.

All made possible by [helaili/jekyll-action](https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action).
