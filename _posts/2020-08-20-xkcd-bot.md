A chatbot using [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and the [XKCD JSON interface](https://xkcd.com/json.html).

This project allows Discord server admins to invite the bot to their server and request XKCD comics. I wrote this project as a daily user of Discord and a consumer of XKCD comics. I enjoyed working on this project as it allowed me to familiarize myself with the Discord bot API, and how to scrape data from the web - both important skills for a data scientist. 

One problem I encountered was repl.it closing active repos within 5 minutes of activity, however this was overcome by using Flask to deploy a web server and querying it using [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/). A guide I found useful is located [here](https://www.codementor.io/@garethdwyer building-a-discord-bot-with-python-and-repl-it-miblcwejz) which was a great introduction to Discord.py and repl.it.

If you are interested in playing with XKCD-Bot, you may add it to your server [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=742180630120366162&permissions=83968&scope=bot) and view the [source code](https://github.com/sjsteer/XKCD-Bot).
