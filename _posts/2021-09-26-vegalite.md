Following on from my previous post, my next assignment for FIT3179 Data Viz at Monash University was a similar project. For this project, I investigated the uptake of solar energy in Australia.

This project was my first exposure to client side data visualization, through the [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) and [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) libraries. The source code for this project is available [here](https://github.com/sjsteer/FIT3179-Assignment2) and the live-copy of the visualization [here](https://sjsteer.github.io/FIT3179-Assignment2/).
